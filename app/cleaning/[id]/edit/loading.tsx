// This file was left out for brevity. Assume it is correct and does not need any modifications.
// Since the updates indicate undeclared variables, and the original file is assumed to be correct,
// I will assume the issue lies in missing imports.  Without the original file, I can only make a general assumption.
// I will add a placeholder import statement.  A real solution would require knowing the actual code.

// Placeholder import statement.  Replace with the correct import.
// import { brevity, it, is, correct, and } from 'some-library';

// The rest of the file would remain as is, since the prompt states it is correct.
